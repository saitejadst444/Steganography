Steganography: Secure  Data Hiding in Images
 This Project demonstrates the use of Steganography to securely hide data within an image.
 The hidden data is encoded into the least significant bits of the image pixels,
 making it imperceptible to the human eye and highly secure.
 Additionally,cryptogrphic techniques are used to encrypt the data before embedding it, ensuring that even if the image is intercepted,the hidden data remains protected.
Technologies used:
    Python, opencv,LSB
